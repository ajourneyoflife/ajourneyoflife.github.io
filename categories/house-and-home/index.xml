      <description>I peeked in Ross today, looking for odds and ends, and stumbled upon a stash of cookbooks $6 or less. I seriously considered this [Hello, Cupcake][1] book for $3, but resisted the urge and placed the book back on the rack. Lucky for me I can pick it up at my library or check out their [website][2] for inspiration!
However, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist the urge and I bought [Deceptively Delicious][3] by [Jessica Seinfield][4] (yes, that&amp;rsquo;s funny man Jerry&amp;rsquo;s wife) for $5.</description>

      <description>I love coffee and every few years I learn of a new way to make some brew. I started out with an old fashioned coffee maker in college (the Gevalia free gift kind), upgraded to a Black &amp;amp; Decker Brew ‘N Go after I was married, I have a wonderful Briel espresso machine, purchased a Bodum french press and am now using a Toddy Cold Brew Coffee System that produces a coffee concentrate that will keep in your refrigerator for up to two weeks.</description>
