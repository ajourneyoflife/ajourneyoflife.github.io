      <description>basic to several recipes is odori, that gift at the frutta e verdura tucked into your shopping bag as you leave. With the odori, you make a trito, a mince of the vegetables, which are then sauteed in olive oil until softened.
Finely chop 2 carrots, 2 stalks celery, 1 onion, 2 cloves garlic, and a handful of parsley. Saute in 2 tablespoons olive oil until golden.
“Less is more” applies directly to this and other Tuscan recipes, which tend to have few ingredients.</description>
