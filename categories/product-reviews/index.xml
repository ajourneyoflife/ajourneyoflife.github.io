      <description>I love coffee and every few years I learn of a new way to make some brew. I started out with an old fashioned coffee maker in college (the Gevalia free gift kind), upgraded to a Black &amp;amp; Decker Brew â€˜N Go after I was married, I have a wonderful Briel espresso machine, purchased a Bodum french press and am now using a Toddy Cold Brew Coffee System that produces a coffee concentrate that will keep in your refrigerator for up to two weeks.</description>
