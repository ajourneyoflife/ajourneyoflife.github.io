      <description>I love pintos and cornbread (or sour cream cornbread). In fact, I’m going to be making some later this week.
I started making pintos in college and they are one of my very first meals I served when “entertaining”. College students are always up for a good meal. Pintos are one of my favorite meals for the following reasons: easy to make (can cook using a crock pot, stove, hot plate, or a campfire), one pot meal (easy cleanup), good for you, very filling, extremely affordable, you can always have the ingredients on hand (you can flavor it with ham, fatback/striped meat, ham hocks, bacon, or nothing at all), can be served all year long, tastes better the second day, can use cooked beans to make soup, chili or refried beans, and to top it off, freezes well.</description>
