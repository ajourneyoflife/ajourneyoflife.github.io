      <description>Ingredients 1/4 cup honey
1/4 cup hot water
1 cup apple cider (apple juice will work in a pinch!)
1 bottle of merlot (or Cabernet Sauvignon)*
cinnamon (optional)
apple slices (optional)
ice cubes
Mix honey and water. Add apple cider and cinnamon. Add wine and ice cubes. Garnish with apple slices.
I&amp;rsquo;m on a boxed wine kick these days, so I usually make the honey/water/cider/cinnamon mixture and keep it in a jar in the fridge.</description>
