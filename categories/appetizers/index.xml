      <description>…the old fashioned way.
You think I’m joking, right? Well, I’m not.
Reasons to pop popcorn the old fashioned way:
It saves money. I purchased a 32 oz. bag of generic popcorn kernels for $1.00, regular price. Those kernels will yield 108 cups of popped popcorn. You will need some sort of cooking oil, so factor in that cost as well. Microwave popcorn is usually on sale for $2.00 a box.</description>
