      <guid>/articles/2011/07/15/white-sangria/</guid>
      <description>The longer sangria sits before drinking, the more smooth and mellow it will taste. A full day is best, but if that’s impossible, give it an absolute minimum of 2 hours to sit. Use large, heavy, juicy oranges and lemons for the best flavor. Doubling or tripling the recipe is fine, but you’ll have to switch to a large punch bowl in place of the pitcher. A Pinot Grigio or an un-oaked Chardonnay are the best choices for this recipe.</description>

      <description>I peeked in Ross today, looking for odds and ends, and stumbled upon a stash of cookbooks $6 or less. I seriously considered this [Hello, Cupcake][1] book for $3, but resisted the urge and placed the book back on the rack. Lucky for me I can pick it up at my library or check out their [website][2] for inspiration!
However, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist the urge and I bought [Deceptively Delicious][3] by [Jessica Seinfield][4] (yes, that&amp;rsquo;s funny man Jerry&amp;rsquo;s wife) for $5.</description>

      <description>I love pintos and cornbread (or sour cream cornbread). In fact, I’m going to be making some later this week.
I started making pintos in college and they are one of my very first meals I served when “entertaining”. College students are always up for a good meal. Pintos are one of my favorite meals for the following reasons: easy to make (can cook using a crock pot, stove, hot plate, or a campfire), one pot meal (easy cleanup), good for you, very filling, extremely affordable, you can always have the ingredients on hand (you can flavor it with ham, fatback/striped meat, ham hocks, bacon, or nothing at all), can be served all year long, tastes better the second day, can use cooked beans to make soup, chili or refried beans, and to top it off, freezes well.</description>

I started out with an old fashioned coffee maker in college (the Gevalia free gift kind), upgraded to a Black &amp;amp; Decker Brew ‘N Go after I was married, I have a wonderful Briel espresso machine, purchased a Bodum french press and am now using a Toddy Cold Brew Coffee System that produces a coffee concentrate that will keep in your refrigerator for up to two weeks.</description>

      <description>…the old fashioned way.
You think I’m joking, right? Well, I’m not.
Reasons to pop popcorn the old fashioned way:
It saves money. I purchased a 32 oz. bag of generic popcorn kernels for $1.00, regular price. Those kernels will yield 108 cups of popped popcorn. You will need some sort of cooking oil, so factor in that cost as well. Microwave popcorn is usually on sale for $2.00 a box.</description>

      <description>basic to several recipes is odori, that gift at the frutta e verdura tucked into your shopping bag as you leave. With the odori, you make a trito, a mince of the vegetables, which are then sauteed in olive oil until softened.
Finely chop 2 carrots, 2 stalks celery, 1 onion, 2 cloves garlic, and a handful of parsley. Saute in 2 tablespoons olive oil until golden.
“Less is more” applies directly to this and other Tuscan recipes, which tend to have few ingredients.</description>

      <description>Most of us enjoy a good pot of ham and bean soup, but often we don&amp;rsquo;t have a ham bone on hand or the time to soak and simmer dried beans. Minced prosciutto instantly transforms chicken broth into a ham-flavored soup base. Italian sausage reinforces the pork flavor and makes the soup satisfying and substantial. Canned beans work as well as dried ones, and mashing some of them thickens the soup and gives it body.</description>
